# RDB List

- [2018~SQL Query Optimization Meets Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://parg.co/d64): We show that deep reinforcement learning is successful at optimizing SQL joins, a problem studied for decades in the database community.

- [2013-How did the modern relational database come to be?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-modern-relational-database-come-david-mccaldin): The purpose of this Annotated Bibliography is to illustrate, in chronological order, the major development of database models from 1st generation (network model etc) to second generation (relational) to 3rd generation (e.g. semantic). The Bibliography is presented in order of the year when the paper was published.

- [2017-How does a relational database work](http://coding-geek.com/how-databases-work/): When it comes to relational databases, I can’t help thinking that something is missing. They’re used everywhere. There are many different databases: from the small and useful SQLite to the powerful Teradata. But, there are only a few articles that explain how a database works.

## Books

- [2016-《Relational Database Design and Implementation-4th》📚](https://parg.co/bjE): The book begins by reviewing basic concepts of databases and database design, then turns to creating, populating, and retrieving data using SQL.

- [2023~《Build Your Own Database From Scratch》📚](https://build-your-own.org/database/): This book contains a walk-through of a minimal persistent database implementation. The implementation is incremental. We start with a B-Tree, then add a new concept with each chapter, and eventually go from a simple KV to a mini relational DB.

## Series

- [2019~《数据库内核杂谈》 #Series#](https://www.jianshu.com/nb/25205074): 我希望能够深入浅出地去讲解数据库是一个什么样的系统，以及为什么它最后会演化成这样一个系统，为什么我们都用 SQL 来操作数据，而不是 AQL 或 BQL. 希望读者阅读后，对数据库的理解不再单单只是知道简单的 table, row 等的基本概念或者单单会写些 join, select 的 SQL 语句。而是能从源头真正做到知其所以然。

# Transaction & Concurrency Control

- [2017-A beginner’s guide to ACID and database transactions](http://6me.us/OzSh): Transactions are omnipresent in today’s enterprise systems, providing data integrity even in highly concurrent environments. So let’s get started by first defining the term and the context where you might usually employ it.

# Query Processing

- [2021~比开源快 30 倍的自研 SQL Parser 设计与实践](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/380801055?utm_source=ZHShareTargetIDMore&utm_medium=social&utm_oi=57299368411136): 本文通过介绍词法语法分析器技术和业界的做法，以及过去使用自动生成的词法语法分析器遇到的问题，分享自研 SQL Parser 的设计与实践，以及其带来的性能和功能的提升。
