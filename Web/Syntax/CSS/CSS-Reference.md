* [2017-The invisible parts of CSS](https://madebymike.com.au/writing/the-invisible-parts-of-CSS/#cascade): If you use CSS in your daily work, your primary goal is probably focused around making things ‘look right’. How this is achieved is often far less important than the end result. This means we care less about how CSS works than the correct syntax and visual results.

## Compatibility:  兼容性

* [CSS Compatibility in Internet Explorer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh781508%28v=vs.85%29.aspx): Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was the first fully Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1 (CSS1)-compliant version of Internet Explorer. Windows Internet Explorer 8 is fully compliant with the Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS2.1) specification and supports some features of Cascading Style Sheets, Level 3 (CSS3). Windows Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 add even more support for many CSS3 modules.
