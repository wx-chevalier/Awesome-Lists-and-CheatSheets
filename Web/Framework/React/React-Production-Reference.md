# Performance: 性能优化

* [React Office Site —— Optimizing Performance](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html): For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application.

Though the framework has matured considerably since then, there doesn’t seem to yet be a firm ‘right’ way of doing things.
