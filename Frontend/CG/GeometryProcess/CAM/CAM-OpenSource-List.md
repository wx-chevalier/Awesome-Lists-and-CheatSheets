- [2020-PrusaSlicer ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer): PrusaSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain, including all those based on the Marlin, Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit controllers.

- [2022-PySLM ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/drlukeparry/pyslm)](https://github.com/drlukeparry/pyslm): PySLM is a Python library for supporting development of input files used in Additive Manufacturing or 3D Printing, in particular Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) platforms typically used in both academia and industry. The core capabilities aim to include slicing, hatching and support generation and providing an interface to the binary build file formats available for platforms. The library is built of core classes which may provide the basic functionality to generate the scan vectors used on systems and also be used as building blocks to prototype and develop new algorithms.
