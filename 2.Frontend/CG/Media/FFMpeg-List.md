- [2015-An ffmpeg and SDL Tutorial](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/): This tutorial is meant for people with a decent programming background. At the very least you should know C and have some idea about concepts like queues, mutexes, and so on. You should know some basics about multimedia; things like waveforms and such, but you don't need to know a lot, as I explain a lot of those concepts in this tutorial.

- [2022-FFmpeg: The Ultimate Guide](https://img.ly/blog/ultimate-guide-to-ffmpeg/): This guide covers the ins and outs of FFmpeg starting with fundamental concepts and moving to media transcoding and video and audio processing providing practical examples along the way.

- [2019-ffmpeg.wasm ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg)](https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/): ffmpeg.wasm is a pure WebAssembly/JavaScript port of FFmpeg. It enables video & audio record, convert and stream right inside browsers.

- [Learn FFmpeg libav the Hard Way](https://parg.co/UkX): I was looking for a tutorial/book that would teach me how to start to use FFmpeg as a library (a.k.a. libav) and then I found the "How to write a video player in less than 1k lines" tutorial. Unfortunately it was deprecated, so I decided to write this one.

- [2015-How to Write a Video Player in Less Than 1000 Lines](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.html): There is a sample program that comes with ffmpeg called ffplay. It is a simple C program that implements a complete video player using ffmpeg.
