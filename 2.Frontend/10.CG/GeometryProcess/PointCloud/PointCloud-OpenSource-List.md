# Awesome Point Cloud List

- [2018-pcl ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/PointCloudLibrary/pcl)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl): The Point Cloud Library (PCL) is a standalone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing.

- [2018-point-cloud-utils ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/fwilliams/point-cloud-utils)](https://github.com/fwilliams/point-cloud-utils): Point Cloud Utils (pcu) is a utility library providing the following functionality for 3D processing point clouds and triangle meshes.

- [2020-CloudCompare ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CloudCompare/CloudCompare)](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare): CloudCompare is a 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) processing software. It was originally designed to perform comparison between two 3D points clouds (such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) or between a point cloud and a triangular mesh. It relies on an octree structure that is highly optimized for this particular use-case. It was also meant to deal with huge point clouds (typically more than 10 million points, and up to 120 million with 2 GB of memory).

# Datasets

- [2019-PointCloudDatasets ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/antao97/PointCloudDatasets)](https://github.com/antao97/PointCloudDatasets):This repository provides ShapeNetCore.v2, ShapeNetPart, ModelNet40 and ModelNet10 datasets in HDF5 format. For each shape in these datasets, we use farthest point sampling algorithm to uniformly sample 2,048 points from shape surface. All points are then centered and scaled. We follow the train/val/test split in official documents.

# Editor & Label

- [2013-Plasio ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/verma/plasio)](https://github.com/verma/plasio): plasio is a project by Uday Verma and Howard Butler that implements point cloud rendering capability in a browser. Specifically, it provides a functional implementation of the ASPRS LAS format, and it can consume LASzip-compressed data using LASzip NaCl module. Plasio is Chrome-only at this time, but it is hoped that other contributors can step forward to bring it to other browsers.

- [2020-3d-bat ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/walzimmer/3d-bat)](https://github.com/walzimmer/3d-bat): 3D Bounding Box Annotation Tool (3D-BAT) Point cloud and Image Labeling.
