* [CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)#Course#](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/): In the first 3/4 of the course, we will explore the joys of pure, lazy, typed functional programming in Haskell (warning: euphoric, mind-bending epiphanies may result!). The last 1/4 of the course will consist of case studies in fun and interesting applications of Haskell.
