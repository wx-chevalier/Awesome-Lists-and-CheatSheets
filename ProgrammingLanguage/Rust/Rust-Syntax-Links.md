# Rust Syntax Links

- [2017-Undefined vs Unsafe in Rust](https://parg.co/URP): It’s a very useful but subtle distinction and I feel we’d be able to talk about safety more expressively if this was well known.

* [2014-Rust Borrow and Lifetimes](http://arthurtw.github.io/2014/11/30/rust-borrow-lifetimes.html)

* [2014-Move vs Copy in Rust](https://parg.co/UPa)

* [2016-Understanding Rust: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes](https://parg.co/UPt)

* [2017-What's a reference in Rust?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/11/27/rust-ref/): people who have read the lifetimes chapter in the Rust book and sorta understand it in principle but are still confused about a lot of pretty basic Rust things.

- [2017-
  Tokio internals: Understanding Rust's asynchronous I/O framework from the bottom up](https://cafbit.com/post/tokio_internals/)

- [2018-Async/Await I: Self-Referential Structs](https://parg.co/Ui5): This is the first in a series of blog posts about generators, async & await in Rust. 

- [2018-Writing complex macros in Rust: Reverse Polish Notation](https://rreverser.com/writing-complex-macros-in-rust/)

* [Python Idioms in Rust](http://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2018/03/23/Python-Idioms-in-Rust/): In fact, I found Rust to be rather Pythonic1. ✨ Sure, you have to be careful about types and ownership, but there is a strong case to be made that Rust shares many of the strengths of Python’s syntax.
