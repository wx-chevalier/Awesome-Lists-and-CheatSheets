# Rust Reference

This file aggregates curated popular links for learning Rust. More reference about ITCS can turn to [Awesome Reference: Guide to Galaxy](https://github.com/wxyyxc1992/Awesome-Reference), which collects valuable, popular and up-to-date links for CS, including Programming Language, Software Engineering, Server Side Application, Infrastructure, InfoSecurity, Industrial Application, DataScienceAI, Frontend Technology(iOS, Android, RN, Electron), etc.

# Overview

* [2017-Deep drive into rust programming language](https://parg.co/UP1)

- [2018-Why is Rust difficult?](https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html): Rust is considered difficult to learn by many people but I don’t consider it necessarily a bad thing for a language to be hard to learn.

* [如何看待 Rust 的应用前景](http://www.zhihu.com/question/30407715)

- [Evaluation of performance and productivity metrics of potential programming languages in the HPC environment](http://octarineparrot.com/assets/mrfloya-thesis-ba.pdf)

* [why-rust?](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/why-rust.pdf?hmsr=toutiao.io&utm_medium=toutiao.io&utm_source=toutiao.io)

- [Golang vs Rust vs Dlang 那个更有前途](http://www.zhihu.com/question/27226962)

* [rustlings](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings)

## Case Study

* [Why Rust is the future of robotics](https://parg.co/UVu): We believe Rust is the future of robotics because it enables developers to be fearless, to create and enforce standards, and to build and rely on a strong community.

## CheatSheet

* [2017-Rust CheatSheet](http://phaiax.github.io/rust-cheatsheet/)

# Book

* [The Rust Programming Language #Book#](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/README.html): This book will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.

- [Rust Books #Project#](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks): 一系列对于 Rust 书籍的搜集

- [Rust Primer #Book#](https://github.com/rustcc/RustPrimer): 中国人写的 Rust 编程书籍

* [Rust by Example #Book#](https://rustbyexample.com/): Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

* [2017-Programming Rust #Book#](https://parg.co/UPe): This practical book introduces systems programmers to Rust, the new and cutting-edge language. You’ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level control—imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.

* [2017-Rust Essentials-Second Edition #Book#](https://parg.co/UPI): Leverage the functional programming and concurrency features of Rust and speed up your application development.

- [2016-Algorithm Cookbook in Rust #Book#](https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms): A collection of classic data structures and algorithms, emphasizing beauty and clarity over full generality.

* [2016-Rust-101](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html): This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.

# Tutorial

* [2018-Learning Rust](https://learning-rust.github.io/): Installation, Hello World, Cargo, Crates, Variable bindings, Functions, Primitive Data Types, Operators & Control Flows.

* [2018-Writing a Microservice in Rust](http://www.goldsborough.me/rust/web/tutorial/2018/01/20/17-01-11-writing_a_microservice_in_rust/): Let me begin this article on Writing a Microservice in Rust by talking about C++.
