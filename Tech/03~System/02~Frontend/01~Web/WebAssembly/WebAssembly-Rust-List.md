## Rust

- [2018~Our Vision for Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/06/25/vision-for-rust-and-wasm.html): In a series of follow up posts, we will talk about the next steps for each major component of the Rust and WebAssembly ecosystem.

- [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸ #Series#](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/introduction.html): This small book describes how to use Rust and WebAssembly together.

- [2021~Rust meets the web - a clash of programming paradigms](https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Rust_on_the_Web.html): Most code running on the web is event-based, garbage-collected, and dynamically typed. In stark contrast, Rust is a compiled language with static type- and memory-safety without a garbage-collector. What are the implications for a project that compiles Rust to WebAssembly? I try to answer this question with a fictive story and hands-on code examples.

- [2023~ndavd/ncube ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ndavd/ncube)](https://github.com/ndavd/ncube): ncube allows you to visualize rotating hypercubes of arbitrary dimensions. It works by rotating the hyperdimensional vertices and applying a chain of perspective projections to them until the 3rd dimension is reached. Everything is generated in real time just from the dimension number.

- [2023~Tidy ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zxch3n/tidy)](https://github.com/zxch3n/tidy): Tidy is designed specifically for tree layout. Graph and DAG data are not supported.
