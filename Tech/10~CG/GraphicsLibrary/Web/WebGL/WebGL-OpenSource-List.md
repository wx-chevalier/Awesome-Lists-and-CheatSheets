# WebGL OpenSource List

- [2017~PicoGL.js ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tsherif/picogl.js)](https://github.com/tsherif/picogl.js): PicoGL.js is a minimal WebGL 2 rendering library. It's meant for developers who understand the WebGL 2 rendering pipeline and want to use it, but with a more convenient API. Typical usage of PicoGL.js will involve creating programs, vertex buffers, vertex arrays, uniform buffers, framebuffers, textures, transform feedbacks, and combining them into draw calls.

- [Hilo3d ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/hiloteam/Hilo3d): ðŸŽ® A 3D WebGL Rendering Engine developed by Alibaba Group

- [2023~SwissGL ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/google/swissgl)](https://github.com/google/swissgl): SwissGL is a minimalistic wrapper on top of WebGL2 JS API. It's designed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to manage GLSL shaders, textures and framebuffers when making procedural visualizations or simulations.

- [2024~aestuans/blob ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aestuans/blob)](https://github.com/aestuans/blob): A simple 2D fluid and gravity simulation, written in Rust and rendered with WebGL.
