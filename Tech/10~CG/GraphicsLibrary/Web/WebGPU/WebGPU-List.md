## Books

- [2024~《WebGPU Unleashed: A Practical Tutorial》](https://shi-yan.github.io/webgpuunleashed/): Welcome to "WebGPU Unleashed" - your gateway to the dynamic world of graphics programming. This free book will teach you graphics programming in JavaScript using WebGPU, drawing from my own learning journey.

## Series

- [2020~WebGPU Fundamentals #Series#](https://webgpufundamentals.org/): A set of articles to help learn WebGPU.

- [2021~Learning Web GPU #Series# ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/hjlld/LearningWebGPU)](https://github.com/hjlld/LearningWebGPU): WebGPU tutorials inspired by LearningWebGL.com. Use both WGSL and GLSL/SPIR-V.

- [2022~WebGPU-Step-By-Step #Series# ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jack1232/WebGPU-Step-By-Step)](https://github.com/jack1232/WebGPU-Step-By-Step): This YouTube video series uses the real-world sample apps to explain the WebGPU basics, shader program, GPU buffer, and rendering pipeline. From this video series, you will learn how to create primitives and simple objects in WebGPU. As you gradually progress through the video series, you will get to grips with advanced WebGPU topics, including 3D transformation, lighting calculation, colormaps, and textures. At the same time, you will learn how to create advanced 3D WebGPU objects, including various 3D wireframes, 3D shapes, simple and parametric 3D surfaces with colormaps and textures, as well as 3D surface plots and 2D and 3D fractal graphics described by complex functions. In addition, you will explore new WebGPU features, such as compute shader and storage buffer, and how to use them to simulate large particle systems.

- [2024~From 0 to glTF with WebGPU Code ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Twinklebear/webgpu-0-to-gltf)](https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-0-to-gltf): This repo contains the code for each post in my "From 0 to glTF with WebGPU" blog series. These repos all use my webgpu-webpack To run an example from its subdirectory you can simply run npm install followed by npm run serve. Then open Chrome Beta/Canary (or stable once 113 is out) and point it at localhost:8080.
