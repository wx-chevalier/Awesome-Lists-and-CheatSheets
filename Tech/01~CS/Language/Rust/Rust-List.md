- [2020~《Rust Design Patterns》📚](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html): Rust is not object-oriented, and the combination of all its characteristics, such as functional elements, a strong type system, and the borrow checker, makes it unique. Because of this, Rust design patterns vary with respect to other traditional object-oriented programming languages.
