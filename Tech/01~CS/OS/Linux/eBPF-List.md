# eBPF List

- [2023~The Beginner's Guide to eBPF](https://github.com/lizrice/ebpf-beginners): My report "What is eBPF?" and in-depth book "Learning eBPF" are both available for download from Isovalent or with your subscription to O'Reilly's learning platform. You can buy "Learning eBPF" from any good bookstore (support your local bookshop by ordering it there!)

- [2023~eBPF 开发者教程与知识库：通过小工具一步步学习 eBPF #Series# ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/eunomia-bpf/bpf-developer-tutorial)](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpf-developer-tutorial): 这是一个基于 CO-RE（一次编译，到处运行）的 eBPF 的开发教程，提供了从入门到进阶的 eBPF 开发实践，包括基本概念、代码实例、实际应用等内容。和 BCC 不同的是，我们使用 libbpf、Cilium、libbpf-rs、eunomia-bpf 等框架进行开发，包含 C、Go、Rust 等语言的示例。

- [2023~eunomia-bpf/bpftime ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/eunomia-bpf/bpftime)](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime): bpftime, a full-featured, high-performance eBPF runtime designed to operate in userspace. It offers fast Uprobe and Syscall hook capabilities: Userspace uprobe can be 10x faster than kernel uprobe! and can programmatically hook all syscalls of a process safely and efficiently.

- [2023~DeepFlow ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/deepflowio/deepflow)](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow): The DeepFlow open-source project aims to provide deep observability for complex cloud infrastructures and cloud-native applications. DeepFlow implemented Zero Code data collection with eBPF for metrics, distributed tracing, request logs and function profiling, and is further integrated with SmartEncoding to achieve Full Stack correlation and efficient access to all observability data. With DeepFlow, cloud-native applications automatically gain deep observability, removing the heavy burden of developers continually instrumenting code and providing monitoring and diagnostic capabilities covering everything from code to infrastructure for DevOps/SRE teams.

- [2024~gojue/ecapture ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gojue/ecapture)](https://github.com/gojue/ecapture): Capturing SSL/TLS plaintext without a CA certificate using eBPF. Supported on Linux/Android kernels for amd64/arm64.
