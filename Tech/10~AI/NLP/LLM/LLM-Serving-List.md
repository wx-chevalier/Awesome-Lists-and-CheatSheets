# LLM Serving List

- [2025~skyzh/tiny-llm ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/skyzh/tiny-llm)](https://github.com/skyzh/tiny-llm): A tutorial on LLM serving using MLX for system engineers. The codebase is solely (almost!) based on MLX array/matrix APIs without any high-level neural network APIs, so that we can build the model serving infrastructure from scratch and dig into the optimizations.
