# AI Canon

Research in artificial intelligence is increasing at an exponential rate. It’s difficult for AI experts to keep up with everything new being published, and even harder for beginners to know where to start.

So, in this post, we’re sharing a curated list of resources we’ve relied on to get smarter about modern AI. We call it the “AI Canon” because these papers, blog posts, courses, and guides have had an outsized impact on the field over the past several years.

We start with a gentle introduction to _transformer_ and _latent diffusion_ models, which are fueling the current AI wave. Next, we go deep on technical learning resources; practical guides to building with large language models (LLMs); and analysis of the AI market. Finally, we include a reference list of landmark research results, starting with “Attention is All You Need” — the 2017 paper by Google that introduced the world to transformer models and ushered in the age of generative AI.

# A gentle introduction…

These articles require no specialized background and can help you get up to speed quickly on the most important parts of the modern AI wave.

- **[Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)**: Andrej Karpathy was one of the first to clearly explain (in 2017!) why the new AI wave really matters. His argument is that AI is a new and powerful way to program computers. As LLMs have improved rapidly, this thesis has proven prescient, and it gives a good mental model for how the AI market may progress.
- **[State of GPT](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/db3f4859-cd30-4445-a0cd-553c3304f8e2)**: Also from Karpathy, this is a very approachable explanation of how ChatGPT / GPT models in general work, how to use them, and what directions R&D may take.
- [**What is ChatGPT doing … and why does it work?**](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/): Computer scientist and entrepreneur Stephen Wolfram gives a long but highly readable explanation, from first principles, of how modern AI models work. He follows the timeline from early neural nets to today’s LLMs and ChatGPT.
- **[Transformers, explained](https://daleonai.com/transformers-explained)**: This post by Dale Markowitz is a shorter, more direct answer to the question “what is an LLM, and how does it work?” This is a great way to ease into the topic and develop intuition for the technology. It was written about GPT-3 but still applies to newer models.
- **[How Stable Diffusion works](https://mccormickml.com/2022/12/21/how-stable-diffusion-works/)**: This is the computer vision analogue to the last post. Chris McCormick gives a layperson’s explanation of how Stable Diffusion works and develops intuition around text-to-image models generally. For an even _gentler_ introduction, check out this [comic](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/zs5dk5/i_made_an_infographic_to_explain_how_stable/) from r/StableDiffusion.

# Practical guides to building with LLMs

A new application stack is emerging with LLMs at the core. While there isn’t a lot of formal education available on this topic yet, we pulled out some of the most useful resources we’ve found.

### Reference

- [**Build a GitHub support bot with GPT3, LangChain, and Python**](https://dagster.io/blog/chatgpt-langchain): One of the earliest public explanations of the modern LLM app stack. Some of the advice in here is dated, but in many ways it kicked off widespread adoption and experimentation of new AI apps.
- **[Building LLM applications for production](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html)**: Chip Huyen discusses many of the key challenges in building LLM apps, how to address them, and what types of use cases make the most sense.
- **[Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/)**: For anyone writing LLM prompts — including app devs — this is the most comprehensive guide, with specific examples for a handful of popular models. For a lighter, more conversational treatment, try [Brex’s prompt engineering guide](https://github.com/brexhq/prompt-engineering).
- [**Prompt injection: What’s the worst that can happen?**](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/14/worst-that-can-happen/) Prompt injection is a potentially serious security vulnerability lurking for LLM apps, with no perfect solution yet. Simon Willison gives the definitive description of the problem in this post. Nearly everything Simon writes on AI is outstanding.
- [**OpenAI cookbook**](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main): For developers, this is the definitive collection of guides and code examples for working with the OpenAI API. It’s updated continually with new code examples.
