With the advent and prospering of large language models (LLMs), there is an expanding frontier in using LLMs as core controllers for these autonomous entities. However, a unified view that ties together the diverse studies in this field has been lacking. This repository houses a comprehensive and systematic survey that fills this gap, focusing on LLM-based autonomous AI agents in their construction, applications, and evaluation strategies.

The codebase is powered by GPT-4, Assistance API, AutoGen, Postgres, and Guidance. It's the first of many multi-agent applications that utilize LLMs (large language models) to enable reasoning and decision making with reduced need for explicit rules or logic.
