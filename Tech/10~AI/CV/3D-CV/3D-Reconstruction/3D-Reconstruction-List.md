- [2020~Point2Mesh ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ranahanocka/Point2Mesh)](https://github.com/ranahanocka/Point2Mesh): Point2Mesh is a technique for reconstructing a surface mesh from an input point cloud. This approach "learns" from a single object, by optimizing the weights of a CNN to deform some initial mesh to shrink-wrap the input point cloud. The argument for going this route is: since the (local) convolutional kernels are optimized globally across the entire shape, this encourages local-scale geometric self-similarity across the reconstructed shape surface.

- [2021~pcdmeshing ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cvg/pcdmeshing)](https://github.com/cvg/pcdmeshing): pcdmeshing is a Python package to reconstruct meshes from point clouds using CGAL.
