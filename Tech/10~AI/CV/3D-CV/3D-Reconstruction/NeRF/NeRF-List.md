- [2022~instant-ngp ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/NVlabs/instant-ngp)](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp): Here you will find an implementation of four neural graphics primitives, being neural radiance fields (NeRF), signed distance functions (SDFs), neural images, and neural volumes. In each case, we train and render a MLP with multiresolution hash input encoding using the tiny-cuda-nn framework.
