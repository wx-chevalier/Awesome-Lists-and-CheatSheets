## Books

- [2008-Songho OpenGL Tutorials》📚](http://www.songho.ca/opengl/index.html): This page contains fundamental OpenGL tutorials and notes. All example programs are written by C++ with Code::Blocks IDE, as well as makefiles for Linux and Mac. I mostly use GLUT/FreeGLUT, and each example project includes FreeGLUT header and library files in it for MinGW environment.

- [2010~《OpenGL Tutorials》📚](https://github.com/paroj/gltut): This is a series of tutorials on using OpenGL to do graphical rendering. The code for each tutorial is found in the Tut\* directories. The code alone is not enough information to understand what is going on. The actual documentation is available in several forms.

- [《LearnOpenGL》📚](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL): Welcome to the online book for learning OpenGL! Whether you are trying to learn OpenGL for academic purposes, to pursue a career or simply looking for a hobby, this book will teach you the basics, the intermediate, and all the advanced knowledge using modern (core-profile) OpenGL. The aim of LearnOpenGL is to show you all there is to modern OpenGL in an easy-to-understand fashion with clear examples, while also providing a useful reference for later studies.

  - [《LearnOpenGL 中文版》📚](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/): LearnOpenGL 的目标是使用易于理解的形式，使用清晰的例子，展现现代 OpenGL 的所有知识点，并与此同时为你以后的学习提供有用的参考。
