# Overview

- [2019~Making Containers More Isolated: An Overview of Sandboxed Container Technologies](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/making-containers-more-isolated-an-overview-of-sandboxed-container-technologies/): While the majority of the IT industry is in the midst of adopting container-based infrastructure (cloud-native solution), it is imperative to understand the technology’s limitations.

# Engineering Practices

- [2020~容器技术之发展简史](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ccFkJJz97KcuXdO3r5zdXA): 聊容器技术避不开云原生，聊云原生也避不开容器技术。容器技术和云原生就是一对双螺旋体，容器技术催生了云原生思潮，云原生生态推动了容器技术发展。

# OpenSource

- [Nomad ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://www.nomadproject.io/): A simple and flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage containers and non-containerized applications across on-prem and clouds at scale.

- [LightVM ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](http://cnp.neclab.eu/projects/lightvm/): With LightVM we examine whether there is indeed a strict tradeoff between isolation (VMs) and efficiency (containers). We find that VMs can be as nimble as containers, as long as they are small and the toolstack is fast enough.

- [TinyVM ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/jakogut/tinyvm): TinyVM is a virtual machine with the goal of having a small footprint. Low memory usage, a small amount of code, and a small binary.

- [gVisor ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/google/gvisor): gVisor is a user-space kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system surface.

- [Kata Containers ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://katacontainers.io/): Kata Containers is a new open source project building extremely lightweight virtual machines that seamlessly plug into the containers ecosystem.

- [Hyper Container ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://hypercontainer.io/): Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Runtime.

- [Colima ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima): Container runtimes on macOS (and Linux) with minimal setup.

- [Podman Desktop ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop): A graphical tool for developing on containers and Kubernetes.
