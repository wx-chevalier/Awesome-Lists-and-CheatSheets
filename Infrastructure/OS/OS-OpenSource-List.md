# Showcase

## Scratch

- [bootOS #Project# #Scratch#](https://github.com/nanochess/bootOS): bootOS is a monolithic operating system in 512 bytes of x86 machine code.

- [os-series #Project# #Scratch#](https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series): Write Your Own 64-bit Operating System Kernel From Scratch.

- [SerenityOS #Project#](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity): SerenityOS is a love letter to '90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.

- [Kerla #Project#](https://github.com/nuta/kerla): A new operating system kernel with Linux binary compatibility written in Rust.

- [2022-HelenOS #Project#](https://github.com/HelenOS/helenos): HelenOS is a portable microkernel-based multiserver operating system designed and implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating system functionality such as file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interface into a collection of fine-grained user space components that interact with each other via message passing. A failure or crash of one component does not directly harm others. HelenOS is therefore flexible, modular, extensible, fault tolerant and easy to understand.

# File System

## Sync

- [Syncthing #Project#](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing): Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below. The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important one being the first.
