# Virtualization OpenSource List

- [LightVM #Project#](http://cnp.neclab.eu/projects/lightvm/): . With LightVM we examine whether there is indeed a strict tradeoff between isolation (VMs) and efficiency (containers). We find that VMs can be as nimble as containers, as long as they are small and the toolstack is fast enough.

- [TinyVM #Project#](https://github.com/jakogut/tinyvm): TinyVM is a virtual machine with the goal of having a small footprint. Low memory usage, a small amount of code, and a small binary.

- [gVisor #Project#](https://github.com/google/gvisor): gVisor is a user-space kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system surface.

* [Kata Containers #Project#](https://katacontainers.io/): Kata Containers is a new open source project building extremely lightweight virtual machines that seamlessly plug into the containers ecosystem.

* [Hyper Container #Project#](https://hypercontainer.io/): Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Runtime.
