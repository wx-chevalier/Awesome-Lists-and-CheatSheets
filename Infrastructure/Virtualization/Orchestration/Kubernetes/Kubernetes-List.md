# Overview

- [2015-十分钟带你理解 Kubernetes 核心概念](http://www.dockone.io/article/932)

- [2018-The Kubernetes Effect](https://www.infoq.com/articles/kubernetes-effect): The way we should look at Kubernetes is more like a fundamental paradigm that has implications in multiple dimensions, rather than an API to interact with.

* [2017-Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm](https://platform9.com/blog/kubernetes-docker-swarm-compared/): We’ll walk you through high-level discussions of Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, and then compare them head-to-head.

- [2017-Learning to operate Kubernetes reliably](https://stripe.com/blog/operating-kubernetes): In this post, we’ll explain why we chose to build on top of Kubernetes. We’ll examine how we integrated Kubernetes into our existing infrastructure, our approach to building confidence in (and improving) our Kubernetes’ cluster’s reliability, and the abstractions we’ve built on top of Kubernetes.

- [2018-Top 10 Kubernetes tips and tricks](https://hackernoon.com/top-10-kubernetes-tips-and-tricks-27528c2d0222?source=linkShare-fe48c4221a4c-1516862034)

- [2018-Why Kubernetes is The New Application Server](https://hn.premii.com/#/article/17516706): In this article, I’m going to ask some provocative questions to make my case for Why Kubernetes is the new application server.

## Case Study

- [2017-Kubernetes at GitHub](https://githubengineering.com/kubernetes-at-github/): Moving a critical application to Kubernetes was a fun challenge, and we’re excited to share some of what we’ve learned with you today.

* [2017-Kubernetes clusters for the hobbyist](https://github.com/hobby-kube/guide#cluster-size): This guide answers the question of how to setup and operate a fully functional, secure Kubernetes cluster on a cloud provider such as DigitalOcean or Scaleway.

# Resource

## Book

- [2017-Kubernetes 中文指南/云原生应用架构实践手册 #Book#](https://github.com/rootsongjc/kubernetes-handbook): 本书记录了本人从零开始学习和使用 Kubernetes 的心路历程，着重于经验分享和总结，同时也会有相关的概念解析，希望能够帮助大家少踩坑，少走弯路，还会指引大家关于关注 kubernetes 生态周边，如微服务构建、DevOps、大数据应用、Service Mesh、Cloud Native 等领域。

* [2017-Kubernetes for Java Developers #Book#](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/kubernetes-for-java-developers.pdf): Orchestrate Multi-Container Applications with Ease

- [2017-Kubernetes The Hard Way #Series#](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way): This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster. If that's you then check out Google Kubernetes Engine, or the Getting Started Guides.

## Courses

- [2017-Introduction to Kubernetes #Course#](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes): Want to learn Kubernetes? Get an in-depth primer on this powerful system for managing containerized applications.

- [2017-Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes (Udacity) #Course#](https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615): This course is designed to teach you about managing application containers, using Kubernetes

## Collection

- [2018-Resources for Getting Started with Kubernetes](https://vsupalov.com/getting-started-with-kubernetes/): Hand-picked reading material and courses to help you make progress towards getting started with Kubernetes.

## Interactive Playground

- [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/): Play with Kubernetes is a labs site provided by Docker and created by Tutorius. Play with Kubernetes is a playground which allows users to run K8s clusters in a matter of seconds.

# Tutorials

- [Kubernetes 101 & 201 #Series#](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/k8s101/): For Kubernetes 101, we will cover kubectl, Pods, Volumes, and multiple containers. For Kubernetes 201, we will pick up where 101 left off and cover some slightly more advanced topics in Kubernetes, related to application productionization, Deployment and scaling.

## Helm

- [使用Helm优化Kubernetes下的研发体验：基础设施即代码](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NdQYzMfRnQv7YatX7075Eg): 本文中，笔者将以一个Spring Boot程序为例，介绍如何在软件研发端到端过程中是使用Helm。
