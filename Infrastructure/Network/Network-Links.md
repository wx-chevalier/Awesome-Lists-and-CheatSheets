- [2016-Beej's Guide to Network Programming Using Internet Sockets #Book#](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/): This is my little how-to guide on network programming using Internet sockets, or "sockets programming", for those of you who prefer it. The sockets API, though started by the Berkeley folk, has been ported to many many platforms, including Unix, Linux, and even Windows.

- [The Decentralized Web Primer #Book#](https://parg.co/U3D): This primer contains a series of Tutorials explaining IPFS, Merkle Trees and the Decentralized Web. It's written and maintained as a gitbook so people can read it in many formats.
