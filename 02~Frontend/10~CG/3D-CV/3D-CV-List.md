- [2018~An Invitation to 3D Vision: A Tutorial for Everyone 🗃️](https://github.com/mint-lab/3dv_tutorial): An Invitation to 3D Vision is an introductory tutorial on 3D vision (a.k.a. geometric vision or visual geometry or multi-view geometry). It aims to make beginners understand basic theory of 3D vision and implement their own applications using OpenCV. In addition to tutorial slides, example codes are provided in the purpose of education. They include simple but interesting and practical applications. The example codes are written as short as possible (mostly less than 100 lines) to be clear and easy to understand.

- [2022~DiffusionNet ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nmwsharp/diffusion-net)](https://github.com/nmwsharp/diffusion-net): DiffusionNet is a general-purpose method for deep learning on surfaces such as 3D triangle meshes and point clouds. It is well-suited for tasks like segmentation, classification, feature extraction, etc.
