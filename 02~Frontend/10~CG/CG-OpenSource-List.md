# Showcase

- [2019~ssloy/tinykaboom ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ssloy/tinykaboom)](https://github.com/ssloy/tinykaboom): This repository is a teaching aid for my computer graphics lectures. It is not meant to produce the ultimate or even physically realistic renders. It is meant to be simple. This project is distributed under the DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE.

- [2021~Graphics Workshop ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg)](https://github.com/ekzhang/graphics-workshop#quilt-patterns): This repo contains a selection of projects designed to help you learn the basics of computer graphics. We'll be writing shaders to render interactive two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenes.
