# Overview

- [2020-C 语言发展史的点点滴滴](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rJVEKjxIrfiV-nSluvXZVg): 一直想写一篇关于 C 语言的文章，里面包含 C 语言的发展史、创始人等相关事迹。但是却迟迟未写，主要原因是因为：在我看来，这个语言太过于伟大、耀眼。作为一个仅仅使用过 C 语言的普通开发来说，完全没资格去写。但是，最近在看过一篇丹尼斯.里奇写的《C 语言发展史》之后，坚定了我写这篇文章的决心。不是歌功颂德，仅仅是以一种客观的视角去欣赏。

# Resource

- [2023-《Beej's Guide to C Programming》》📚](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/index.html): In the old days, C was a simpler language. A good number of the features contained in this book and a lot of the features in the Library Reference volume didn’t exist when K&R wrote the famous second edition of their book in 1988. Nevertheless, the language remains small at its core, and I hope I’ve presented it here in a way that starts with that simple core and builds outward.

# Tutorial

- [2020-Write a Shell in C #Series#](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/): University students beware! Many classes have assignments that ask you to write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code. If you’re a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code without permission. And even then, I would advise against heavily relying on this tutorial.

- [2022-Building a simple shell in C #Series#](https://blog.ehoneahobed.com/building-a-simple-shell-in-c-part-1): A basic shell that prints a prompt, waits for user to enter command and prints what they entered on the next line.

- [2022-Everything I wish I knew when learning C](https://tmewett.com/c-tips/): This page is a living collection of summaries, signposts, and advice for these broader points that made my journey with C and other compiled languages easier. I hope it’s useful to you!
