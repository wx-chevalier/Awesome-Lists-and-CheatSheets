# [Awesome Lists: Systematic & Structured Guide to Galaxy](https://github.com/wx-chevalier/Awesome-List/blob/master/README-en.md)

Everyone may be very familiar with the so-called awesome list:

> An awesome list is a list of awesome things curated by the community, about everything from CLI applications to fantasy books. Just like other thousands of awesome lists,

[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/wx-chevalier/Awesome-List/blob/master/README-en.md) collects curated, worthy and up-to-date links for ITCS, including Programming Language(Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.), Software Engineering, Backend(Spring, Nginx, MicroServices, etc.), Infrastructure(Database, Network, etc.), InfoSecurity & Penetration, Industrial Application, DataScienceAI(Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, CV), Frontend Technology(iOS, Android, RN, Electron), etc. Note that I've attempted to order the books in order of most "tackleable". So the idea is to read books from top to bottom.

What's the difference between [Awesome Lists](./) and others?

- All lists are organized in a systematic and structured way, keep to my Ultimate Knowledge Graph(see below).

- Links in single list are ordered mannualy, seperated into multiple sections: Overview, Resources(Books, Course, etc), Tutorial, etc.

## Navigation

Finally, Let these lists speak for themselves:

- If you wan't to learn Web Development, you may like [DOM List](./Web/Syntax/DOM/DOM-List.md), [CSS List](./Web/Syntax/CSS/CSS-List.md), [React List](./Web/Framework/React/React-List.md), [Redux List](./Web/Framework/Redux/Redux-List.md), [Vue List](./Web/Framework/Vue/Vue-List.md), [PWA List](./Web/Tuning/PWA/Web-PWA-List.md), [Web Performance List](./Web/Tuning/Performance/Web-Performance-List.md), [WebAssembly List](), etc.
