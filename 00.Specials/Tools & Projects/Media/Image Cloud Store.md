I use it for syncing the photo streams of all the iDevices in my house back to my server because it's the only way of backing up multiple devices to a single location. It uses the system keyring to securely store credentials, has HEIC to JPG conversion capability, and can send Telegram, Prowl, Pushover, WebHook, DingTalk, Discord, openhab, IYUU and WeCom notifications.
