# Transformer List

- [2023-The Transformer Family Version 2.0](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-27-the-transformer-family-v2/): Many new Transformer architecture improvements have been proposed since my last post on “The Transformer Family” about three years ago. Here I did a big refactoring and enrichment of that 2020 post — restructure the hierarchy of sections and improve many sections with more recent papers. Version 2.0 is a superset of the old version, about twice the length.
