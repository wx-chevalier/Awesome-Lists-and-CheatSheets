# GPU List

- [2021~GPU architecture types explained](https://rastergrid.com/blog/gpu-tech/2021/07/gpu-architecture-types-explained/): The behavior of the graphics pipeline is practically standard across platforms and APIs, yet GPU vendors come up with unique solutions to accelerate it, the two major architecture types being tile-based and immediate-mode rendering GPUs. In this article we explore how they work, present their strengths/weaknesses, and discuss some of the implications the underlying GPU architecture may have on the efficiency of certain rendering algorithms.
