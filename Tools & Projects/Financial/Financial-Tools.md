# Financial Tools

- [2023~Actual ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/actualbudget/actual)](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual): Actual is a local-first personal finance tool. It is 100% free and open-source, written in NodeJS, it has a synchronization element so that all your changes can move between devices without any heavy lifting.

- [2023~maybe ![code](https://ng-tech.icu/assets/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/maybe-finance/maybe)](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe): This is the original React app of the previously-defunct personal finance app, Maybe. This original version used many external services (Plaid, Finicity, Auth0, etc) and getting it to fully function will be a decent amount of work.
