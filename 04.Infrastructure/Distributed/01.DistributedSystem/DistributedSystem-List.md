# Distributed System List

# Overview

- [漫谈分布式系统、拜占庭将军问题与区块链](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tngWdvoev8SQiyKt1gy5vw): 今天本文就借这个机会，跟大家一起讨论一下分布式系统的核心问题和概念。最后，我们将尽量沿着逻辑上前后一贯的思路，讨论一下区块链技术。

# Resource

## Books

- [2012-《Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures》📚](http://berb.github.io/diploma-thesis/): We examine the relations between concurrency, scalability and distributed systems and dare an outlook on the near future.

- [2012-《The Art of Multiprocessor Programming》-Revised Reprint](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/the-art-of/9780123973375/): The Art of Multiprocessor Programming is an authoritative guide to multicore programming. It introduces a higher level set of software development skills than that needed for efficient single-core programming. This book provides comprehensive coverage of the new principles, algorithms, and tools necessary for effective multiprocessor programming.

- [2011-Özsu-《Principles of Distributed Database Systems》-3rd Edition》📚](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441988331): The first part discusses the fundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design, data integration, distributed query processing and optimization, distributed transaction management, and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and includes discussion of parallel database systems, distributed object management, peer-to-peer data management, web data management, data stream systems, and cloud computing.

- [2013-《Distributed systems for fun and profit》📚](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/): In this text I've tried to provide a more accessible introduction to distributed systems. To me, that means two things: introducing the key concepts that you will need in order to have a good time reading more serious texts, and providing a narrative that covers things in enough detail that you get a gist of what's going on without getting stuck on details. It's 2013, you've got the Internet, and you can selectively read more about the topics you find most interesting.

- [2017-《Designing Data Intensive Applications》📚](https://dataintensive.net/): This book will help you navigate the diverse and fast-changing landscape of technologies for storing and processing data.

  - [DDIA 中文翻译](https://github.com/Vonng/ddia): 这是 2017 年译者读过最好的一本技术类书籍，这么好的书没有中文翻译，实在是遗憾。某不才，愿为先进技术文化的传播贡献一份力量。既可以深入学习有趣的技术主题，又可以锻炼中英文语言文字功底，何乐而不为？

- [2018-Programming Models for Distributed Computation》📚](https://github.com/heathermiller/dist-prog-book): This is a book about the programming constructs we use to build distributed systems. These range from the small, RPC, futures, actors, to the large; systems built up of these components like MapReduce and Spark. We explore issues and concerns central to distributed systems like consistency, availability, and fault tolerance, from the lens of the programming models and frameworks that the programmer uses to build these systems.

## Collection

- [The Twelve-Factor App 🗃️](http://12factor.net/zh_cn/): To raise awareness of some systemic problems we’ve seen in modern application development, to provide a shared vocabulary for discussing those problems, and to offer a set of broad conceptual solutions to those problems with accompanying terminology.

- [awesome-shell 🗃️](https://github.com/alebcay/awesome-shell): A curated list of awesome command-line frameworks, toolkits, guides and gizmos. Inspired by awesome-php.

- [Cloud Native Landscape 🗃️](https://github.com/cncf/landscape): Static Cloud Native Landscapes and Interactive Landscape that filters and sorts hundreds of cloud native projects and products, and shows details including GitHub stars, funding or market cap, first and last commits, contributor counts, headquarters location, and recent tweets.
