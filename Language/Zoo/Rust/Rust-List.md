## Case Study

- [Why Rust is the future of robotics](https://parg.co/UVu): We believe Rust is the future of robotics because it enables developers to be fearless, to create and enforce standards, and to build and rely on a strong community.

- [2018-Rust in production at Figma](https://blog.figma.com/rust-in-production-at-figma-e10a0ec31929): How Mozilla’s new language dramatically improved our server-side performance.

## Book

- [The Rust Programming Language #Book#](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/README.html): This book will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.

- [Rust Primer #Book#](https://github.com/rustcc/RustPrimer): 中国人写的 Rust 编程书籍

- [Rust by Example #Book#](https://rustbyexample.com/): Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

- [2016-Algorithm Cookbook in Rust #Book#](https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms): A collection of classic data structures and algorithms, emphasizing beauty and clarity over full generality.

- [2016-Rust 101 #Book#](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html): This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.

- [2017-Programming Rust #Book#](https://parg.co/UPe): This practical book introduces systems programmers to Rust, the new and cutting-edge language. You’ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level control—imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.

- [2017-Rust Essentials-2nd #Book#](https://parg.co/UPI): Leverage the functional programming and concurrency features of Rust and speed up your application development.

## Collection

- [Rust Books #Collection#](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks): 一系列对于 Rust 书籍的搜集。

## Course

- [TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust #Course#](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan). A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world and practical Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.

- [TP 202: Distributed Systems in Rust #Course#](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/). Adapted from the [MIT 6.824](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html) distributed systems coursework, this course focuses on implementing important distributed algorithms, including the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm, and the [Percolator](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/36726.pdf) distributed transaction protocol.
